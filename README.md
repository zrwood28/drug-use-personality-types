# Drug Use & Personality Type: ML Model Evaluation

Project Team Members: Ben Johnson, Joey Eikens, Yameena Khan, and Zach Wood
____________
## Project Overview 
Is it possible to predict illegal drug using personality test results and basic demographic information? To answer this question, we built four different ML models capable of predicting if someone has used illegal drugs in the past year. An overview of the results of each model is shown below.
